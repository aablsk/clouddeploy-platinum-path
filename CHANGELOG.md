2022-07-19 v0.15.0  Brinigng clarity and cleanliness after Hurricane Alex: https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/issues/18
2022-07-19 v0.14.0  Substantially changed the code for Solution ONe. I've done two BIG things:
                    1. Looked at all the code here: https://github.com/palladius/clouddeploy-platinum-path/tree/main/k8s/amarcord/original-solution1-dmarzi/_ORIGINAL
                    2. Also changed bname to GatewayClassName to 'gke-l7-gxlb'
2022-07-18 v0.13.1  Solution1 pretty much refactored. Many sol1 put ast beginning, also added where they didnt exist before (big bug fixed).
                    Plus using "ricc-env: staging" vs "stage: canary" which didnt work at all!
2022-07-18 v0.13.0  Script 15.sh is now fully multitennant! Plus I've added to Common Templates the COMMON stage.
2022-07-17 v0.12.0  Fixed script 15.sh finally!
