* P3 b/0001  The Hash declared in .env.sh.post needs bash v4. My Linux has it, but my Mac doesnt. Fopr the first time
  after 2mo coding on my Mac, this is not working. Luckily there is a semi-ugly workaround. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1494178/how-to-define-hash-tables-in-bash
  for bash v3. My mac has version 3.2.57(1)-release (arm64-apple-darwin21).
