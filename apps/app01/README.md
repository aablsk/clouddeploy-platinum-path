This code was taken from https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/
under `examples/buildpacks-python` folder.

### Example: buildpacks (Python)

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold&cloudshell_open_in_editor=README.md&cloudshell_workspace=examples/buildpacks-python)

This is an example demonstrating:

* **building** a Python app built with [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/)
* **tagging** using the default tagPolicy (`gitCommit`)
* **deploying** a single container pod using `kubectl`

## Hitsory

* 1.3 Installed locally and finally fixed. (1) 
* 1.2 was broken
* 1.0 it worked! I know cos its still runnign in prod!

(1) Sorry I dont know how to use the magic modules locally so I had to install conda locally and do the effort myself
